\item The equation of a circle with origin as centre and passing through the vertices of an equilateral triangle whose median is of length $3 a$ is
\begin{enumerate}
\item $x^2+y^2=9a^2$
\item $x^2+y^2=16a^2$
\item $x^2+y^2=4a^2$
\item $x^2+y^2=a^2$
\end{enumerate}
 \item Show that the point $(x,y)$ given by $x=\frac{2at}{1+t^2}$ and $y=\frac{a(1-t^2)}{1+t^2}$ lies on a circle for all real values of $t$ such that -1$\le t \le $1 where $a$ is any given real number. 
 \item lf a circle passes through the point $(0,0), (a,0)$ and $(0,b)$ then find the coordinates of its centre.
\item The equation of the circle circumscribing the triangle whose sides are the lines $y=x+2, 3y=4x, 2y=3x$ is  \makebox[1cm]{\hrulefill}
