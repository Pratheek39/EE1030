Let $\alpha$ be the angle made by the line with the axes.  The unit direction vector can be expressed as
    \begin{align}
	    \vec{x} &= \myvec{\cos\alpha\\\cos\alpha\\\cos\alpha} 
	\implies
	    \norm{\vec{x}}  = 1
	\\
	    \text{or, }\cos\alpha &= \frac{1}{\sqrt{3}}
    \end{align}
    Thus the unit direction vector  of the given line is 
    \begin{align}
	    \vec{x} = \frac{1}{\sqrt{3}} \myvec{1 \\ 1 \\ 1} 
\end{align}
