	\item Two immiscible, incompressible, viscous fluids having same densities but different viscosities are contained between two infinite horizontal prallel plates, $2m$ apart as shown below. The bottom plate is fixed and the upper plate moves to the right with a constant velocity of $3m/s$. With the assumptions of Newtonian fluid, steady, and fully developed laminar flow with zero pressure gradient in all directions, the momentum equations simplify to
		\begin{align}
			\frac{d^2u}{dy^2} &= 0;
		\end{align}
If the dynamic viscosity of the lower fluid, $\mu_2$, is twice that of the upper fluid,$\mu_1$, then the velocity at the interface (round off to two decimal places) is \underline{\hspace{2cm}}$m/s$.

	\item A cube of side $100mm$ is placed at the bottom of an empty container on one of its faces. The density of the material of the cube is $800kg/{m^3}$. Liquid of density $1000 kg/{m^3}$ is now poured into the container.

	\item Three slabs are joined together as shown in the figure. There is no thermal contact resistance at the interfaces. The center slab experiences a non-uniform internal heat generation with an average value to $10000 Wm^{-3}$, while the left and right slabs have no internal heat generation. All slabs have thickness equal to $1m$ and thermal conductivity of each slab is equal to$5Wm^{-1}K^{-1}$. The two extreme faces are exposed to fluid with heat transfer coefficient $100Wm^{-2}K^{-1}$ and bulk temperature $30^{\circ}C$ as shown. The heat transfer in the slabs is assumed to be one dimesional and steady, and all properties are constant. If the left extreme face temperature $T_1$ is measured to be $100^{\circ}C$, the right extreme face temperature $T_2$ is \underline{\hspace{2cm}}$^{\circ}C$.
